# Brow Bag Talk Hands On

### This is sample geospatial tools that may be helpful in image and vector handling

#### Main process includes 

1. boundingbox_from_centroid_1.ipynb
    * create a bounding box based on a centroid lat/lon point
2. extract_pixvals_from_point_2.ipynb
    * extract pixel values from geotif imagery data 
3. raster_shift.ipynb
    * shift (move) a raster file (geotiff image) to x, y direction based on number of pixels
4. grid_generation_4.ipynb
    * vector grid generation with user defined rows and cols
5. raster_rotation_single_band_5.ipynb
    * rotate a single band geotiff image based on user defined angles
6. image_segmentation_6.ipynb
    * RGB image segmentation algorithm using CV
7. raster_reproject_latlon_to_utm_7.ipynb
    * reproject geotif image from geographic lat/lon to UTM projection
8. raster_tools_8.ipynb
    * misc. tools for handling raster files
9. equidistance_between_two_points_9.ipynb
    * compute regular intervals location between 2 points
